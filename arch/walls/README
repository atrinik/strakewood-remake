=== NAMING CONVENTION FOR WALL ARCHETYPES ===

All directional walls should be named in the following convention:

<wall name><window>_<direction>

where:

<wall name> is the wall's name, for example, wall_wood2, wall_white, etc
<window> should only be used for walls with window, and should always be "_w".
<direction> is the wall's direction:
            - 1 for walls facing south
            - 3 for walls facing east
            - 4 for walls facing both south and east
            - 8 for walls facing both north and west


Look at the wall_wood_xxx archetypes for an example.
